Mandatory reading
=================

Take a look at example_ on how to multi-build your Cython extensions.

.. _example: https://github.com/smok-serwis/snakehouse/blob/develop/example/setup.py

Don't place modules compiled that way in root .py file's top level imports.
Wrap them in a layer of indirection instead!

This applies to unit tests as well!

When something goes wrong (eg. the application throws an unhandled exception)
the built module has a tendency to dump core.
Try to debug it first by passing :code:`dont_snakehouse=True` to your
modules in the debug mode.

Also note that if you are compiling in :code:`dont_snakehouse`
mode then your modules should have at least one of the following:

* a normal Python :code:`def`
* a normal Python class (not :code:`cdef class`)
* a line of Python initialization, eg.

.. code-block:: python

   a = None

or

.. code-block:: python

   import logging

   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Otherwise :code:`PyInit` won't be generated by Cython
and such module will be unimportable in Python. Normal import won't suffice.
